        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p class="p-left"> But in her web she still delights<br>
            To weave the mirror's magic sights,<br>
            For often thro' the silent nights<br>
            A funeral, with plumes and lights<br>
            And music, went to Camelot:<br>
            Or when the moon was overhead,<br>
            Came two young lovers lately wed:<br>
            <span class="lady">&ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; said
            The Lady of Shalott.</span> </p>
            
        <p class="p-right"> His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;<br>
            On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;<br>
            From underneath his helmet flow'd<br>
            His coal-black curls as on he rode,<br>
            As he rode down to Camelot.<br>
            From the bank and from the river<br>
            He flash'd into the crystal mirror,<br>
            <span class="lancelot">&ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the river
            Sang Sir Lancelot.</span> </p>
            
        <p class="p-left"> She left the web, she left the loom,<br>
            She made three paces thro' the room,<br>
            She saw the water-lily bloom,<br>
            She saw the helmet and the plume,<br>
            She look'd down to Camelot.<br>
            Out flew the web and floated wide;<br>
            The mirror crack'd from side to side;<br>
            <span class="lady">&ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried
            The Lady of Shalott.</span> </p>
