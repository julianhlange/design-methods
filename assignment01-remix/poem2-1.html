        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p> But in her web she still<span class="verbs"> delights</span><br>
            To <span class="verbs"> weave</span> the mirror's magic sights,<br>
            For often thro' the silent nights<br>
            A funeral, with plumes and lights<br>
            And music,<span class="verbs"> went</span> to Camelot:<br>
            Or when the moon<span class="verbs"> was</span> overhead,<br>

            &ldquo;I<span class="verbs"> am</span> half sick of shadows,&rdquo;<span class="verbs"> said</span><br>
            The Lady of Shalott. </p>

            On burnish'd hooves his war-horse<span class="verbs"> trode</span>;<br>
            From underneath his helmet<span class="verbs"> flow'd</span><br>
            His coal-black curls as on he<span class="verbs"> rode</span>,<br>
            As he<span class="verbs"> rode</span> down to Camelot.<br>
            From the bank and from the river<br>
