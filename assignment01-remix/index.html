        <h2> The Lady of Shalott (1842)<br>
        <span id="by">by</span> <span id="author">Alfred Tennyson</span> </h2>
        <p> <span id="larger">Synopsis</span><br>
        On an island near Camelot in King Arthur's realm, the Lady of Shalott weaves a
        tapestry depicting the world outside her window. However, she is cursed: she must
        only view the world via its reflection in a mirror.
        One day the knight Lancelot rides by on his horse, returning from battle. His
        irresistible image and song draw her to look directly outside. The mirror cracks;
        the curse is upon her.
        Realizing that her life is ending, she lays herself into a boat that floats downriver,
        eventually bringing her dead body into Camelot. </p>
        
        <p> <span id="larger">Stanzas 8 & 12 & 13 (of 19)</span><br>
        These three stanzas capture the poem's main theme. Tennyson was writing about his burden
         as a poet: to remain detached and at a distance from his subject&mdash;society&mdash;while
        reflecting on it through his poetry. </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="poem"> But in her web she still delights</img><br>
        To weave the mirror's magic sights,<br>
        For often thro' the silent nights<br>
        A funeral, with plumes and lights<br>
        And music, went to Camelot:<br>  <img src="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01543_10.jpg"/>
        Or when the moon was overhead,<br>
        Came two young lovers lately wed:<br>
        &ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; said<br>
        The Lady of Shalott. </p>
            
        <p class="poem"> His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;<br>
        On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;<br>
        From underneath his helmet flow'd<br>
        His coal-black curls as on he rode,<br>
        As he rode down to Camelot.<br>
        From the bank and from the river<br>
        He flash'd into the crystal mirror,<br>
        &ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the river<br>
        Sang Sir Lancelot. </p>
            
        <p class="poem"> She left the web, she left the loom,<br>
        She made three paces thro' the room,<br>
        She saw the water-lily bloom,<br>
        She saw the helmet and the plume,<br>
        She look'd down to Camelot.<br>
        Out flew the web and floated wide;<br>
        The mirror crack'd from side to side;<br>
        &ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried<br>
        The Lady of Shalott. </p>
