        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p> <span class="first-stanza">But in her web she still delights</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">To weave the mirror's magic sights,</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">For often thro' the silent nights</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">A funeral, with plumes and lights</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">And music, went to Camelot:</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">Or when the moon was overhead,</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">Came two young lovers lately wed:</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">&ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; said</span><br>
            <span class="first-stanza">The Lady of Shalott.</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">From underneath his helmet flow'd</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">His coal-black curls as on he rode,</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">As he rode down to Camelot.</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">From the bank and from the river</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">He flash'd into the crystal mirror,</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">&ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the river</span><br>
            <span class="second-stanza">Sang Sir Lancelot.</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">She left the web, she left the loom,</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">She made three paces thro' the room,</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">She saw the water-lily bloom,</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">She saw the helmet and the plume,</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">She look'd down to Camelot.</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">Out flew the web and floated wide;</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">The mirror crack'd from side to side;</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">&ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried</span><br>
            <span class="third-stanza">The Lady of Shalott.</span> </p>
