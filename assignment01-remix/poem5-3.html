        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p> But in her <span class="noun">web</span> she still delights<br>
            To weave the <span class="noun">mirror</span>'s magic <span class="noun">sights</span>,<br>
            For often thro' the silent <span class="noun">nights</span><br>
            A <span class="noun">funeral</span>, with <span class="noun">plumes</span> and <span class="noun">lights</span><br>
            And <span class="noun">music</span>, went to <span class="noun">Camelot</span>:<br>
            Or when the <span class="noun">moon</span> was overhead,<br>
            Came two young <span class="noun">lovers</span> lately wed:<br>
            &ldquo;I am half sick of <span class="noun">shadows</span>,&rdquo; said<br>
            The <span class="noun">Lady of Shalott</span>. </p>
            
        <p> His broad clear <span class="noun">brow</span> in <span class="noun">sunlight</span> glow'd;<br>
            On burnish'd <span class="noun">hooves</span> his <span class="noun">war-horse</span> trode;<br>
            From underneath his <span class="noun">helmet</span> flow'd<br>
            His coal-black <span class="noun">curls</span> as on he rode,<br>
            As he rode down to <span class="noun">Camelot</span>.<br>
            From the <span class="noun">bank</span> and from the <span class="noun">river</span><br>
            He flash'd into the crystal <span class="noun">mirror</span>,<br>
            &ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the <span class="noun">river</span><br>
            Sang <span class="noun">Sir Lancelot</span>. </p>
            
        <p> She left the <span class="noun">web</span>, she left the <span class="noun">loom</span>,<br>
            She made three <span class="noun">paces</span> thro' the <span class="noun">room</span>,<br>
            She saw the <span class="noun">water-lily</span> bloom,<br>
            She saw the <span class="noun">helmet</span> and the <span class="noun">plume</span>,<br>
            She look'd down to <span class="noun">Camelot</span>.<br>
            Out flew the <span class="noun">web</span> and floated wide;<br>
            The <span class="noun">mirror</span> crack'd from <span class="noun">side</span> to <span class="noun">side</span>;<br>
            &ldquo;The <span class="noun">curse</span> is come upon me,&rdquo; cried<br>
            The <span class="noun">Lady of Shalott</span>. </p>
