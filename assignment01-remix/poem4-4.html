        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p> But in her web she still delights
            To weave the mirror's magic sights,
            For often thro' the silent nights
            A funeral, with plumes and lights
            And music, went to Camelot:
            Or when the moon was overhead,
            Came two young lovers lately wed:
            &ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; said
            The Lady of Shalott.
            
            His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;
            On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;
            From underneath his helmet flow'd
            His coal-black curls as on he rode,
            As he rode down to Camelot.
            From the bank and from the river
            He flash'd into the crystal mirror,
            &ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the river
            Sang Sir Lancelot.
            
            She left the web, she left the loom,
            She made three paces thro' the room,
            She saw the water-lily bloom,
            She saw the helmet and the plume,
            She look'd down to Camelot.
            Out flew the web and floated wide;
            The mirror crack'd from side to side;
            &ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; cried
            The Lady of Shalott. </p>
