        <h2> The Lady of Shalott </h2>
        
        <p>But in her web she still <span class="rhyme">delights&nbsp</span><br>
            To weave the mirror's magic <span class="rhyme">sights,</span><br>
            For often thro' the silent <span class="rhyme">nights&nbsp</span><br>
            A funeral, with plumes and <span class="rhyme">lights&nbsp</span><br>
            And music, went to <span class="rhyme lot">Camelot:</span><br>
            Or when the moon was <span class="rhyme">overhead,</span><br>
            Came two young lovers lately <span class="rhyme">wed:</span><br>
            &ldquo;I am half sick of shadows,&rdquo; <span class="rhyme">said&nbsp</span><br>
            The Lady of <span class="rhyme lot">Shalott.</span> </p>
            
        <p> His broad clear brow in sunlight <span class="rhyme">glow'd;</span><br>
            On burnish'd hooves his war-horse <span class="rhyme">trode;</span><br>
            From underneath his helmet <span class="rhyme">flow'd&nbsp</span><br>
            His coal-black curls as on he <span class="rhyme">rode,</span><br>
            As he rode down to <span class="rhyme lot">Camelot.</span><br>
            From the bank and from the <span class="rhyme">river&nbsp</span><br>
            He flash'd into the crystal <span class="rhyme">mirror,</span><br>
            &ldquo;Tirra lirra,&rdquo; by the <span class="rhyme">river&nbsp</span><br>
            Sang Sir <span class="rhyme lot">Lancelot.</span> </p>
            
        <p> She left the web, she left the <span class="rhyme">loom,</span><br>
            She made three paces thro' the <span class="rhyme">room,</span><br>
            She saw the water-lily <span class="rhyme">bloom,</span><br>
            She saw the helmet and the <span class="rhyme">plume,</span><br>
            She look'd down to <span class="rhyme lot">Camelot.</span><br>
            Out flew the web and floated <span class="rhyme">wide;</span><br>
            The mirror crack'd from side to <span class="rhyme">side;</span><br>
            &ldquo;The curse is come upon me,&rdquo; <span class="rhyme">cried&nbsp</span><br>
            The Lady of <span class="rhyme lot">Shalott.</span> </p>
